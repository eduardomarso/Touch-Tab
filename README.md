# Touch-Tab
Emulate Command-Tab with Trackpad on macOS.
Use 3-fingers swipe right (emulates Command-Tab) or 3-fingers swipe left (emulates Command-Shift-Tab) to switch between apps.
Pause after the swipe (or do it slowly) to show the App Switcher.

# Installation
1. Downolad the lates release from [Releases](https://github.com/ris58h/Touch-Tab/releases) page.
2. Unzip the archive and move the app into the /Applications folder.
3. Allow the app to listen for trackpad events. Allow Touch-Tab to control your computer in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accesibility`.
4. Disable 3-finger swipe between full-screen apps. `System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen apps`.

# Troubleshooting
## "Touch-Tab" canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software
Right-click the app and press `Open`, a pop-up will appear, click `Open` again.
## It's opened but doesn't work
Allow the app to listen for trackpad events. Allow Touch-Tab to control your computer in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accesibility`.
## It still doesn't work
Disable 3-finger swipe between full-screen apps. `System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen apps`.
