# Touch-Tab

Emulate Command-Tab with Trackpad on macOS.
Use 3-fingers swipe right (emulates Command-Tab) or 3-fingers swipe left (emulates Command-Shift-Tab) to switch between apps.
Hold after the swipe or swipe slowly to show the App Switcher UI.

# Installation
1. Download the latest `Touch-Tab-VERSION.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/ris58h/Touch-Tab/releases) page.
2. Unzip the archive and move the app into the `Applications` folder.
3. The app is ad-hoc signed so macOS will warn you: `"Touch-Tab" can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software`. Right-click the app and press `Open`, a pop-up will appear, click `Open` again.
4. The app needs access to trackpad events. Allow Touch-Tab to control your computer in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accesibility`. Don't forget to restart the app!
5. Disable 3-finger swipe between full-screen apps or make it 4-finger in `System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen apps`.

# Usage
- Use 3-fingers swipe right (emulates Command-Tab) or 3-fingers swipe left (emulates Command-Shift-Tab) to switch between apps.
- Hold after the swipe or swipe slowly to show the App Switcher UI. Pro tip: you can use 2-fingers scroll (which is faster) after the App Switcher is shown.

# Troubleshooting
## "Touch-Tab" can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software
Right-click the app and press `Open`, a pop-up will appear, click `Open` again.
## It's running, but doesn't work
- Check that Touch-Tab is allowed to control your computer in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accesibility`. Don't forget to restart the app!
- Check that 3-finger swipe is disabled in `System Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Swipe between full-screen apps`.
## It still doesn't work
